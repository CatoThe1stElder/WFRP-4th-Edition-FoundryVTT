When Entangling an opponent, you cannot otherwise use the weapon to hit. You can end the Entangling whenever you wish.",
  "fast": "Fast weapons are designed to strike out with such speed that parrying is not an option, leaving an opponent skewered before they can react. A wielder of a Fast weapon can choose to attack with the Fast weapon outside of the normal Initiative sequence, either striking first, last, or somewhere in between as desired. Further, all Melee Tests to defend against Fast weapons suffer a penalty of –10 if your opponent is using a weapon without the Fast Quality; other Skills defend as normal. Two opponents with Fast weapons fight in Initiative order (relative to each other) as normal. A Fast weapon may never also be Slow (Slow takes precedent).",
  "hack": "Hacking weapons have heavy blades that can hack through armor with horrific ease. If you hit an opponent, you Damage a struck piece of armor or shield by 1 point as well as wounding the target.",
  "impact": "Some weapons are just huge or cause terrible damage due to their weight or design. On a successful hit, add the result of the units die of the attack roll to any Damage caused by an Impact weapon. An Undamaging weapon can never also have Impact (Undamaging takes precedent).",
  "impale": "Impale weapons can kill with a single clean blow. Impale weapons cause a Critical Hit on any number divisible by 10 (i.e.: 10, 20, 30, etc.) as well as on doubles (i.e.: 11, 22, 33) rolled equal or under an appropriate Test in combat. If the impale comes from a ranged weapon, the ammunition used has firmly lodged itself in the target’s body. Arrows and bolts require a successful Challenging (+0) Heal Test to remove — bullets require a surgeon (see the Surgery Talent in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents). You cannot heal 1 of your Wounds for each unremoved arrow or bullet.",
  "penetrating": "The weapon is highly effective at penetrating armour. Non-metal APs are ignored, and the first point of all other armour is ignored.",
  "pistol": "You can use this weapon to attack in Close Combat.",
  "precise": "The weapon is easy to get on target. Gain a bonus of +1 SL to any successful Test when attacking with this weapon.",
  "pummel": "Pummel weapons are especially good at battering foes into submission. If you score a Head hit with a Pummel weapon, attempt an Opposed Strength/ Endurance test against the struck opponent. If you win the test, your opponent gains a Stunned Condition.",
  "repeater": "Your weapon holds (Rating) shots, automatically reloading after each time you fire. When you use all your shots, you must fully reload the weapon using the normal rules.",
  "shield": "If you use this weapon to oppose an incoming attack, you count as having (Rating) Armour Points on all locations of your body. If your weapon has a Shield Rating of 2 or higher (so: Shield 2 or Shield 3), you may also Oppose incoming missile shots in your Line of Sight.",
  "trapblade": "Some weapons are designed to trap other weapons, and sometimes even break them. If you score a Critical when defending against an attack from a bladed weapon you can choose to trap it instead of causing a Critical Hit. If you choose to do this, enact an Opposed Strength Test, adding your SL from the previous Melee Test. If you succeed, your opponent drops the blade as it is yanked free. If you score an Astounding Success, you not only disarm your opponent, but the force of your maneuver breaks their blade unless it has the Unbreakable quality. If you fail the Test, your opponent frees the blade and may fight on as normal.",
  "unbreakable": "The weapon is exquisitely well-made or constructed from an especially strong material. Under almost all circumstances, this weapon will not break, corrode, or lose its edge.",
  "wrap": "Wrap weapons typically have long chains with weights at the end, making it very difficult to parry them effectively. Melee Tests opposing an attack from a Wrap weapon suffer a penalty of –1 SL, as parried strikes wrap over the top of shields, or around blades.",
  "flexible": "Flexible armor can be worn under a layer of non-Flexible armor if you wish. If you do so, you gain the benefit of both.",
  "impenetrable": "The armor is especially resilient, meaning most attacks simply cannot penetrate it. All Critical Wounds caused by an odd number to hit you, such as 11 or 33, are ignored.",
  "durable": "Laboriously crafted using strong materials, the item can take +Durable Damage points before it suﬀers any negatives and gains a saving throw of 9+ on a <a class = 'chat-roll'><i class='fas fa-dice'></i> 1d10</a> roll against instant breakage from sources like Trap Blade. This Quality can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, the saving throw improves by 1 (e.g. From 9+ to 8+).",
  "fine": "Meticulously crafted to please the eye. This Quality is a sign of social status and can be taken multiple times. The higher the quality, the more impressive it seems.",
  "lightweight": "Cleverly crafted for ease of carrying. Reduce Encumbrance points by 1.",
  "practical": "Expertly crafted with utility in mind. A failed test using this item receives +1 SL. If the item is a piece of armor, any penalties for wearing it are reduced by one level (for example from -30 to -20).",

  "imprecise": "Imprecise weapons are difficult to bring to bear as they are unwieldy or hard to aim. Suffer a penalty of –1 SL when using the weapon to attack. An Imprecise Weapon can never be Precise (Imprecise takes precedent).",
  "reload": "The weapon is slow to reload. An unloaded weapon with this flaw requires an Extended Ranged Test for the appropriate Weapon Group scoring (Rating) SL to reload. If you are interrupted while reloading, you must start again from scratch.",
  "slow": "Slow weapons are unwieldy and heavy, making them difficult to use properly. Characters using Slow weapons always strike last in a Round, regardless of Initiative order. Further, opponents gain a bonus of +1 SL to any Test to defend against your attack",
  "tiring": "The weapon is fatiguing to use or difficult to bring to bear. You only gain the benefit of the Impact and Damaging Weapon Traits on a Turn you Charge.<br><br><b>Note:</b> This changes the Damage shown in the chat card:<br> 'Not Charging' | 'Charging' Damage.",
  "undamaging": "Some weapons are not very good at penetrating armour. All APs are doubled against Undamaging weapons. Further, you do not automatically inflict a minimum of 1 Wound on a successful hit in combat.",
  "partial": "The armor does not cover the entire hit location. An opponent that rolls an even number to hit, or rolls a Critical Hit, ignores the partial armor’s APs.",
  "weakpoints": "The armor has small weakpoints where a blade can slip in if your opponent is sufficiently skilled or lucky. If your opponent has a weapon with the Impale Quality and scores a Critical, the APs of your armor are ignored.",
  "ugly": "Crafted without any aesthetic awareness whatsoever, Ugly items attract negative attention, and related Fellowship Tests might even suﬀer a –10 penalty.",
  "shoddy": "Hastily crafted by an amateur or fraudster. The item breaks when used in any failed Test rolling a double. Similarly, Shoddy armor breaks if any Critical Hit is sustained to a Hit Location it protects.",
  "unreliable": "Crafted without attention to functionality, a failed test using this item receives –1 SL. Further, penalties for wearing Unreliable armor are doubled.",
  "bulky": "An awkward design crafted clumsily. Increase Encumbrance by +1 (small trinkets cannot normally have this ﬂaw). Bulky clothing and armor are Enc 1 even when worn, and Fatigue penalties for armor are doubled."

If you roll Body, luckily the Gangrene did not settle in during this infection. If you roll Head, your nose is aﬀected. If you roll Arms, it’s your fingers. If you roll Leg, it’s your feet. Each day, roll an <b>Average (+20) Endurance</b> Test. If you pass, you hold oﬀ the Gangrene; if you fail, it grows worse. If you ever fail more times than you have Toughness Bonus, you completely lose all capability with the aﬀected location. If this occurs, use the same rules as Amputated Parts. For as long as you have Gangrene, suﬀer a penalty –10 to all Fellowship Tests, and suﬀer the Wounded symptom. Further, if not already suffering it, you also suﬀer from Blight until the aﬀected tissue is amputated; this remains even if you are cured of the disease that started the Gangrene. ",
  "lingering" : "You have an infection that just refuses to go away. Indeed, you fear it may be getting worse… After your disease reaches the end of its duration, attempt an Endurance Test with the Difficulty marked on the symptom like so: Lingering (Average) or Lingering (Easy). If this scores a Marginal Failure (0), the duration extends for an extra <a class = 'chat-roll'><i class='fas fa-dice'></i> 1d10</a> days. If it scores a Failure (–2), develop a Festering Wound. On an Astounding Failure (–6), you instead develop Blood Rot. ",
  "malaise" : "You don’t feel at all well. You are tired, find it hard to concentrate, and just generally ill. Take a <a class='condition-chat'><i class='fas fa-user-injured'></i> Fatigued</a> Condition that you can only remove when you have recovered from your illness. ",
  "nausea" : "You feel very sick and are prone to vomiting if you move around too quickly. Whenever you fail a Test involving physical movement, your nausea overwhelms you and you vomit. You gain the <a class = 'condition-chat'><i class='fas fa-user-injured'></i> Stunned</a> condition, which represents you being sick repeatedly or dry heaving, depending upon your current circumstances. ",
  "pox" : "You are covered in pustules, inﬂamed swellings, disgusting rashes, or itchy spots, which are unlikely to be your most attractive feature. Pox are largely a cosmetic issue, resulting in a penalty of –10 to Fellowship Tests. Additionally, remember to roleplay and describe all the scratching; if you want to withhold from this for a while, pass an <b>Average (+20) Cool</b> Test. When the Pox ends, attempt an <b>Average (+20) Cool</b> Test. If this fails, reverse the Test dice and apply permanent scarring to that Hit Location, showing an area where you scratched and the pox there healed badly. If the <a class='table-click' data-table = 'hitloc'><i class='fas fa-list'></i> Hit Location</a> is the head, permanently lose 1 in Fellowship.",
  "wounded" : "You have a wound or open sore that does not heal properly because of an infection. For each Wounded symptom you have, you cannot heal one of your Wounds, which stays open and sore, possibly seeping foul-smelling pus. Every day, take an <b>Easy (+20) Endurance</b> Test or gain a Festering Wound if you do not already have one.",
  "delirium" : "Your sensibility comes and goes, with moments of clarity replaced suddenly by bouts of raving, hallucinations, and terror. Make a <b>Challenging (+0) Willpower Test</b> each hour, and consult the <a class='table-click' data-table='delirium'><i class='fas fa-list'></i> Delirium</a> table.",
  "swelling" : "A part of the body swells up to several times its normal size, turning an angry red or purple colour and becoming almost unusable. The affected body part is normally the location of a wound or bite causing the Swelling, or the point of contact where a disease or infection entered the body.<br><br><b>Head</b>: The eyes and tongue bulge, the cheeks become livid, the jaw is forced open. Eating is impossible, but clear liquids maybe sipped in small quantities. Any Tests requiring speech are 3 steps more Difficult.<br><b>Arm</b>:The arm and hand swell, the shoulder and elbow joints cannot move, and the hand becomes useless. For the duration, the arm counts as Amputated (WFRP, page 180).<br><b>Body</b>: The entire body swells until the sufferer can no longer wear clothes. All Tests involving movement become 3 steps more Difficult.<br><b>Leg</b>: The leg swells grotesquely, becoming as wide as the widest part of the thigh for its entire length. The foot is almost indistingushable. For the duration, the leg counts as Amputated (WFRP, page 180)."

  "convulsions" : "Rare herbs and alchemical mixes can lessen this symptom for a day, bringing Severe down to Moderate, and Moderate down to standard convulsions. These can be created by any with the Trade (Apothecary) skill and access to the appropriate ingredients (which can cost upwards of 10 shillings or more per dose).

  "malaise" : "Medicine treating Malaise, costing anything from a few pence to a handful of silver, is usually genuine (75% chance); and, if so, pass a <b>Challenging (+0) Endurance</b> Test to ignore the symptom for the day.",

Larger temples of Shallya often keep a stock of the cream for free (though donations are expected) and apothecaries and herbalists of all kinds sell similar products for relatively low prices (rarely more than six or seven pence for a week’s worth of treatment, with a 90% chance of being genuine medicine). Using a cream increases all Cool Tests to resist scratching to <b>Very Easy (+60)</b>, but is usually unsightly.",
